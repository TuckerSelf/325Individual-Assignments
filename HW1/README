 * @brief The Custom Vector Assignment
 * 
 * The program creates a custom vector class and uses it to make a list of intergers depending on the
 * user's input.
 *
 *
 * Upon running the ./vector, the code in the main file runs all appropriate tests in order to make sure
 * the class is working properly. The user may input a positive interger of thier choice, having the vector
 * "list" expand large enough to contain the number of intergers as it inputs them in numerical order.
